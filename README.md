Assignment for the TU Delft Master Course: AE4238 Aero Engine Technology

## Assumtions
1. The change of pressure in the combustion chamber is linear ()second derivative is zero)
2. The specific heat are assumed constant w.r.t. temperture
3. Fuel does not alter the Individual gas constant of the exhaust air (hot nozzle)
4. 

## Ideas
Make table of governing relations between stages w/ assumptions
