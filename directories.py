""" directories.py is a file containing the function get_dir which allows the user to quickly call a directory within
the project folder, also for convenience the packages os and sys are imported when directories.py is imported with
the * specifier. Finally the dictionary DIRS contains common directories so as to avoid multiple calls to get_dir.
Finally since the entries in DIRS are outputs of get_dir the inherent directory checking is also present. Thus an
invalid directory will raise errors
